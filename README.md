## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a third-year student at the Faculty of Information Technology, Ton Duc Thang University, majoring in Software Engineering.

I have a particular interest in analyzing and designing information systems, especially in working with UML diagrams. I'm gradually building my skills in back-end development, aiming to create helpful and easy-to-use systems.

Recently, I've also been exploring the field of artificial intelligence and find it fascinating, with a focus on how it can be applied to solve real-world problems. I'm always eager to learn more and improve through hands-on experience and collaboration.
